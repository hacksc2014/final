BeatFlicker
============

##About

This is our first hackathon, so we decided to go for something not so ambitious. We were all interested somewhat in developing for Android, so we decided to make an app that took a facet of mobile development, the acclerometer, and attempted to implement it in a music app. We took inspiration from the fact that many of us were casual musicians who could enjoy the ability to create customize music on the go. Our app therefore is aimed at both users who are completely new to music and those who are experts, as BeatFlicker acts as a simple tool for expressing musical creativity. The app boasts a variety of instruments to choose from and allows playbacks of one's favorite created tracks.
